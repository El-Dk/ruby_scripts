This repository contains four scripts that are part of The Odin Projects' curriculum

The scripts are:
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Sub Strings
  - Stock Picker
  - Bubble Sort

Caesar Cipher's Assignment.- Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and  
                             the shift factor and then outputs the modified string

Sub Strings' Assignment.- Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the
                          first argument and then an array of valid substrings 
                          (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should 
                          return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) 
                          that was found in the original string and how many 
                          times it was found.
                        
Stock Picker's Assignment.- Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array 
                            of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It 
                            should return a pair of days representing the best day 
                            to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0 

Bubble Sort's Assignment.-  Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and 
returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology
